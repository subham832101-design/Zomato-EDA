# Zomato-EDA

## 🛠️ Project Overview
This repository performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Zomato restaurant dataset to explore patterns in:
- Online ordering and table booking availability  
- Customer ratings and votes  
- Approximate cost for two  
- Types of restaurants and cuisines

The goal is to understand key trends in restaurant performance and customer preferences using data visualization and statistical summary.

## Data Source
The dataset consists of restaurant listings with fields like name, online_order/book_table options, rating, votes, cost for two people, and restaurant category.

## Steps in Analysis
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess data (missing values, formatting)  
3. Perform exploratory analysis (distribution, relationships)  
4. Visualize trends via plots (bar plots, count plots, etc.)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## Key Insights
- Most restaurants fall into specific categories (e.g., dining)  
- Patterns observed in online order availability, cost and rating relationships  
- Visual plots help identify trends in restaurant engagement
